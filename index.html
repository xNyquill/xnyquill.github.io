        <p>I have been a member of the Ford Credit team since 2016 and worked in Customer Service the entire time. I started in Account Maintenance, back when it was called High Risk, and then moved to the Charlotte Loss Prevention team quickly after LP was expanded. While my position has not changed too much over the years, I have expanded my contributions in my Diversity and Inclusion initiatives. I have been the Chair of the Nashville Business Center Chapter of Ford GLOBE since 2018, which now has been merged with all the other FMCC North American Chapters and been rebranded. I now continue to serve on the Board of the FMCC North American Ford Pride chapter. I also participate as a member of the Nashville Change Agents, a grassroots effort to make change regarding racial and social injustice in the work environment.</p>

        <p>I joined this recruitment for software engineers as a way to merge my hobbies and passions with my professional life. Growing up as the personal computer and internet was being brought into the every day home, I have always had a fascination and respect of technology. I was introduced to gaming at a very young age and it became, and has remained, my main hobby. While in school though, I fell in love with music and began to pursue that professionally. Unfortunately since the pandemic, I have had to refocus my aspirations due to music venues being closed or limited. Becoming a software engineer would be the perfect opportunity for me to pursue a similar creative outlet such as music and once again merge my professional life with something I am passionate about.</p>
